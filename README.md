# pocket-sync

A Windows / Mac / Linx GUI to do _stuff_ with the Analogue Pocket.

![The Cores List](./readme_images/cores_list.png)

Features:

- Browse & install cores
- Export corrected & upscalled screenshots
- Backup save files
- Quick links to open game file folders

## Installation

- Download the installer for your platform from [The Latest Release](https://github.com/neil-morrison44/pocket-sync/releases/latest)
- Note you'll need to click through to allow the application on Windows & allow the application from within the Security pane in Settings on MacOS since I can't be bothered setting up (& paying yearly for) the signing process
- Plug in your Pocket / put in the SD card, click "Connect to Pocket", select the root folder (the one with Assets & Cores & Saves etc in it) and go
- It'll slap a `pocket_sync.json` file on to your pocket to hold config on first run

## Roadmap

### Soon

- Installing / Checking for firmware updates
- Hopefully get the saves backups working how I'd planned

### Longer term

- Add back MiSTer save file sync (don't really want to touch it if there's a chance I'll clopper MiSTer files with a bunch of incompatiable Genesis saves)

## FAQs

### Donations?

Nah, I'm alright - you should donate to the folks porting / building cores over though.
